1. TypeScript is also a programming language that preserves the runtime behavior of JavaScript. For example, dividing by zero in JavaScript produces Infinity instead of throwing a runtime exception. As a principle, TypeScript never changes the runtime behavior of JavaScript code.

2. Erased Types
Roughly speaking, once TypeScript’s compiler is done with checking your code, it erases the types to produce the resulting “compiled” code. This means that once your code is compiled, the resulting plain JS code has no type information.
